Creating a secure, scalable, auto-healing, highly available, auto-scalable, resilient, and cost-optimized infrastructure in AWS involves implementing a combination of AWS services and best practices. Below is a high-level overview of how to achieve these objectives:

1. **Security:**
   - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage user access and permissions.
   - Implement network security using Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Security Groups, and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs).
   - Encrypt data in transit using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL/TLS certificates and AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption keys.
   - Enable encryption at rest for data stored in AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon EBS volumes.

2. **Scalability:**
   - Design your application architecture using scalable AWS services like Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, and Amazon S3.
   - Use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand and predefined scaling policies.
   - Leverage Amazon CloudFront for content delivery to improve the scalability of your web applications and APIs.
   - Utilize AWS Lambda for serverless compute to handle spikes in demand without provisioning or managing servers.

3. **Auto-Healing:**
   - Implement health checks for your EC2 instances and application components using Amazon CloudWatch.
   - Use AWS Auto Scaling to replace unhealthy instances automatically based on predefined health check criteria.
   - Leverage AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across healthy instances and perform health checks.

4. **High Availability:**
   - Deploy your application across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region to achieve fault tolerance.
   - Use AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances or containers running in different AZs.
   - Utilize multi-AZ configurations for AWS services like Amazon RDS, Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon S3 to ensure high availability of data and resources.

5. **Auto-Scalability:**
   - Configure AWS Auto Scaling to automatically scale your application resources up or down based on predefined metrics such as CPU utilization, network traffic, or custom metrics.
   - Use AWS Lambda with event-driven architecture to trigger scaling actions based on specific events or conditions.

6. **Resilience:**
   - Design your architecture with redundancy and failover mechanisms to mitigate the impact of failures.
   - Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies using AWS services like Amazon S3 for data backup and AWS Backup for centralized backup management.
   - Leverage AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon Route 53 for DNS failover and global load balancing across AWS regions.

7. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Utilize AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets to monitor and optimize your AWS spending.
   - Implement Reserved Instances (RIs) or Savings Plans to reduce costs for EC2 instances and other AWS services with predictable usage patterns.
   - Use AWS Trusted Advisor to identify cost optimization opportunities, such as underutilized resources or idle instances.

By following these best practices and leveraging the appropriate AWS services, you can build a secure, scalable, auto-healing, highly available, auto-scalable, resilient, and cost-optimized infrastructure in AWS. It's essential to continuously monitor and optimize your architecture to adapt to changing requirements and ensure optimal performance and efficiency.t
